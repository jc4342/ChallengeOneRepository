## The Past, Present, and Future of OpenAI

 OpenAI was founded on December 11, 2015  in San Francisco, CA. OpenAI has eleven founders, four of whom are still there.  Among the founders is Sam Altman, who is currently the CEO, but was originally co-chair while also the president of Y-Combinator when OpenAI was founded.  Greg Brockman is currently the president of OpenAI and was previously the chief technology officer of the fintech company Stripe before the founding.  According to the Observer, “he connected with Altman in 2015 through Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison, and the two began discussing how they could build safe human level A.I. systems.” This was their original idea behind OpenAI.  Additional founders met later that year to discuss their ideas, including “a crisp vision of building safe A.I. in a project dedicated to benefitting humanity,” according to Brockman.  The other founders include John Schulman, who is currently the head of alignment science at OpenAI, who joined “shortly after he completed a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer sciences at the University of California, Berkeley.”  Wojciech Zaremba is now leader of the OpenAI teams overseeing OpenAI’s GPT models, its coding assistant Github Pilot and programming model Codex, but he became a co-founder of OpenAI while “still completing his Ph.D. in deep learning at New York University with internships at Nvdia, Google and Meta under his belt.”  In the early years of OpenAI, he lead the robotics efforts, which “produced a robotic arm capable of solving a Rubik’s Cube.”  Elon Musk, currently CEO of Tesla and founder of xAI, helped create OpenAI “almost a decade ago in a big to challenge Google’s monopoly on A.I. talent,” and he donated millions of dollars towards OpenAI.  He left in 2018 when he failed to incorporated OpenAI into Tesla, and he has since criticized OpenAI’s technology as not safe and even tried to sue them on the basis that the company no longer follow’s the founder’s original intent to prioritize benefiting humanity over profits.  Ilya Sutskever started as the research direct and became the chief scientist in 2018, but already “one of the world’s top experts in machine learning.”  He has since left after an “unsuccessful attempt to oust Altman,” the current CEO.  Trevor Blackwell is a Canadian computer programmer and a co-founder of Y Combinator, where originally met Altman.  He “worked at openAI as one of its founding researchers until 2017 while serving as a Y Combinator partner until 2020.”  He also a renowned roboticist.  Vicki Cheung was “one of the founding engineers of Duolingo and spent a year as a software engineer at TrueVault” before joining openAI.  She joined  OpenAI when “it was still in stealth mode” and “didn’t really have an interview process,” worked there for two years “head of infrastructure” and then left “for a software engineering job at Lyft.”  She then left Lyft in 2020 to “co-found Gantry,” which “aid companies in analyzing an improving the performances of machine learning models.”  Andrej Karpathy is a Slovakian-Canadian scientist who first joined OpenAI as a “founding research scientist focused on deep learning in computer vision, generative modeling and reinforcement learning.”  In 2017, after Musk had left, “Tesla poached him to oversee neural networks for its Autopilot system.” He then “returned to OpenAI in 2023 but left once again in February,” which he claimed was “not a result of any particular event, issue, or drama.” He we went on to found Eureka Labs, “an A.I. education company that plans to use the technology to aid students in undergraduate-level classes.”  Durk Kingma initially worked with A.I. “in the research lab at New York University from 2009 to 2012,” and “also spent the summers of 2014 and 2015 working at DeepMind while completing a Ph.D. in deep learning and generative models at the University of Amsterdam.”  When he joined OpenAI, “he led its Algorithms team.  He left “in 2018 for Google Brain,” now “merged with DeepMind into a new entity called Google DeepMind,” where “he continues to work as a research scientist focused on generative modes for text, images, and video.”  Pamela Vagata was “one of the only two female members of OpenAI’s founding team,” and her “career in tech began with a software development engineer stint at Microsoft,” before spending “six years at Facebook,”during two of which she worked “as an A.I. research engineer.”  The details of her intial role at OpenAI are unknown, she “played a crucial role in its foundational infrastructure and early products.”  She left OpenAI for Stripe in 2016 as one of its A.I. tech leads.

From a variety of sources, OpenAI has received a total of $11.3 billion in funding over seven rounds, according to tracxn.com.  First, in the early days, the founders “pooled their resources and committed an initial investment of $1 billion,” and angel investors who saw potential “came in with substantial amounts” as well, both of which provided “OpenAI with the financial bedrock needed to set up its first labs, recruit top-tier talent, and starts its pioneering research projects.”  As the company “started to deliver on its promises” and show strong potential, venture capitalist firms liked Adreesen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures brought in “substantial investments” as well as “strategic advice and networking opportunities,” enabling OpenAI to “scale its operations, add more researchers, and invest in more advanced computing resources.”  Although OpenAI is a profit-driven company, “its mission often aligns with public interest,” which makes it “eligible for various government grants,” enabling it  to tap “into government funds to support its research,” therefore receiving “considerable funding from the Department of Defense’s research arm, DARPA,” due to DARPA’s “interest in AI technologies.” This provides OpenAI with the budget “for high-risk, high-reward projects,” and enables them to “aim for ambitious research goals that require substantial funding and advanced resources.”  Corporate partnerships and sponsorships, from companies like Microsoft “allows OpenAI to access state-of-the-art infrastructure without incurring considerable costs,” in exchange for “early access to AI innovations that could revolutionize their own operations.”  Additional sources of funding for OpenAI include donations from wealthy individuals “who believe in the ethical development of AI,” and several foundations and trusts who care about ethical A.I. practices and thus believe in OpenAI’s mission.  These contributions “enable OpenAI to pursue projects that are essential but may not have immediate commercial viability” and often come with “fewer strings attached, allowing OpenAI to the freedom to explore more unconventional or long-term research avenues.”  These contributions to OpenAI are often motivated by people’s desire to make “ an investment in the future of technology and humanity” and an interest in “scientific advancements, human welfare, or ethical AI practice.”  Commercial ventures, such as OpenAI API, offers “powerful AI tools to business and developers on a subscription basis,” thus creating a steady stream of revenue, which “funds ongoing research and operational costs, providing a financial cushion that grows as more people sign on.”  Other products like DALL-E, which “turns textual descriptions into images,” has “commercial applications that bring in considerable income.” When projects pique public interest, OpenAI can generate funds from crowdfunding and community support, which “serve as both a financial boost and a public endorsement.”  OpenAI’s “technology is often licensed to other companies for various applications, generating substantial income,” which not only provides funds but also promotes the widespread use of ethical AI technology.”  The “white-label AI solutions” that OpenAI offers to businesses enables them “to integrate advanced AI features without developing them in-house.”  OpenAI’s participation in “academic collaborations” enables them to receive “grants and funding from various financial institutions,” which in turn “get access to cutting-edge AI resources” while OpenAI “enjoys additional functions and academic rigor in their projects.”  The result of these academic collaborations and pooled resources is “joint research project that push the boundaries of what’s possible in AI,” enabling the academic institutions and OpenAI to “achieve milestone that would be challenging to reach independently.”  OpenAI’s success in global AI competitions earns them financial awards in addition its prestige” by gaining a platform “to showcase their advancements, attract potential investors, and gain widespread recognition.”
